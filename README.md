## Steps to run the application
* Download zip file or clone the repository
* Run setup.sh - This will create virtual environment and all the required dependencies
> ./setup.sh
* Run start.sh - This will start redis, celery worker, celery beat and python server

## Core Functionalities
### 1. Admin login and user login (RBAC)
* A login/register form with fields like username, password etc. for sponsor, influencer and admin login
* The application should have only one admin identified by is role.
* You can either use Flask security or JWT based Token based authentication to implement role based access control
* The app must have a suitable model to store and differentiate all the types of user of the app.

### 2. Admin Dashboard - for the Admin
* The admin should be added automatically whenever a new database is created
* Every new sponsor signup should be approved by the admin
* The request should automatically go to the admin’s dashboard for approval
* The application must have an admin dashboard which displays all the relevant statistics of the application, e.g. active users, campaigns (public/private), ad requests and their status, flagged sponsors/influencers etc.

### 3. Campaign Management - for the sponsors
* Create a new campaign and categorize it into various niches.
* Update an existing campaign - e.g. start_date, end_date, budget and/or other fields
* Delete an existing campaign

### 4. Ad request Management - for the sponsors
* Create ad requests based on the goals on the campaign
* Edit an existing ad request - e.g. influencer_id, requirements, payment_amount, status
* Delete an existing ad request.

### 5. Search for influencers, public campaigns
* The sponsors should be able to search for relevant influencers based on their niche, reach, followers etc.
* The Influencers should be able to search for public campaigns based on their niche, relevance etc.

### 6. Take action on a particular ad request - for the Influencers
* Ability to view all the ad requests from all the campaigns
* Ability to accept/reject a particular ad request
* Ability to negotiate the “payment_amount” for a particular ad

### 7. Backend Jobs
#### Scheduled Job - Daily reminders - The application should send daily reminders to influencers on g-chat using Google Chat Webhooks or SMS or mail
* Check if an influencer has not visited/has pending ad request
* If yes, then send the alert asking them to visit/accept the ad request or checkout the public ad requests
* The reminder can be sent in the evening, every day (students can choose the time)

#### Scheduled Job - Monthly Activity Report - Device a monthly report for the sponsors created using HTML and sent via mail.
* The activity report can consist of campaign details, how many advertisements done, growth in sales of products due to campaigns, budget used/remaining etc.
* For monthly report to be sent, start a job on first day of every month → create a report using above parameters → send it as email

#### User Triggered Async Job - Export as CSV - Devise a CSV format details for the campaigns (public/private) created by the sponsor.
* This export is meant to download the campaign details (description, start_date, end_date, budget, visibility (public, private), goals etc.
* Have a dashboard from where the sponsor can trigger the export
* This should trigger a batch job, send an alert once done

### 8. Performance and Caching

* API Performance
